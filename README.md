# Portfolio Website - Luke Truesdale

Welcome to the personal portfolio website of Luke Truesdale: [luketruesdale.com](https://luketruesdale.com)

This project has been a quarter-semester long development effort, created as part of a course project. It integrates many of the technical concepts covered throughout the semesterâ€”including web development fundamentals, design customization, and cloud deployment.

The site began as a Bootstrap template and was customized using HTML and CSS to better reflect my personal style and professional goals. It is hosted using Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps.

This portfolio acts as a digital extension of my resume, showcasing my skills, experience, and selected projects in a clean and accessible format for potential employers and collaborators.
